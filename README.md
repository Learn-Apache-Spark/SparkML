# Getting started:
Make sure you have docker installed on your device.

1. Run docker

2. Run the next command:

    `docker run -it -p 8888:8888 jupyter/pyspark-notebook`
    
    
   You will get similar answer back:
   ```bash
   Executing the command: jupyter notebook
    [I 15:49:48.293 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret
    [I 15:49:48.887 NotebookApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyterlab
    [I 15:49:48.888 NotebookApp] JupyterLab application directory is /opt/conda/share/jupyter/lab
    [I 15:49:48.891 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/jovyan
    [I 15:49:48.891 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
    [I 15:49:48.891 NotebookApp] http://0a3437183fee:8888/?token=43143a485357351ef522a1840f8c8c141a1be2bcf5f9b4de
    [I 15:49:48.892 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=43143a485357351ef522a1840f8c8c141a1be2bcf5f9b4de
    [I 15:49:48.892 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
    [C 15:49:48.896 NotebookApp]
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-8-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://0a3437183fee:8888/?token=43143a485357351ef522a1840f8c8c141a1be2bcf5f9b4de
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=43143a485357351ef522a1840f8c8c141a1be2bcf5f9b4de
```

Copy the **last** url with the token:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=43143a485357351ef522a1840f8c8c141a1be2bcf5f9b4de
```
and past it in your browswer. 
This will be your jupyter work environment for the course.

3. Clone this repo or download the zipped files - `notebook.zip` and `detecting-twitter-bot-data.zip`

4. Extracte the files(unzip) and upload the `Exercise`, `Solution` and `detecting-twitter-bot-data` files into Jupyter using the upload button.
Use the upload button like in the photo:

5. Follow instructions and write your findings in chat! 



# Notes:
Exercise folder containes the exercise chapters.
Solution folder containes the solution for the exercise.

It's recommend to have both in your Jupyter environment before course starts.
